## 📑 Introduction GRAIL-3D

GRAIL-3D is a novel framework addressing the fundamental challenge of natural language grounding in 3D environments, targeting the dual bottleneck of geometric fidelity degradation in point cloud representations and semantic inflexibility of static linguistic prompts. The framework builds a robust Geometric Scaffold via the GeoEdge module (adopting a non-generative, dual attention mechanism to identify and preserve salient structural edges) and enables fluid, Adaptive Dialogue through an adaptive prompt orchestration network (APON) inspired by Mixture of Experts. APON dynamically selects and refines query templates via closed-loop, metric-informed feedback. Comprehensive experiments verify that GRAIL-3D sets a new state-of-the-art on major 3D QA and captioning benchmarks, achieving a CIDEr score of 84.47 on ScanQA and 70.26 on ScanRefer, and establishes a robust, efficient, and accurate foundation for complex 3D scene understanding through the integration of geometric representation and linguistic interaction.
